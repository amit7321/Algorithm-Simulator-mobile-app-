# Algorithm-Simulator (mobile app)
Data structure and Algorithm is one of the most important subjects for the computer science students. But most of the students face some problems in understanding the subject for lack of visualization. So we feel the necessity of the visualization of the algorithms that we learn at the early stage of data structure course. So our group wants to develop an android application that will visualize those algorithms.This software will help a person to easily understand the algorithms. Initially, we are simulating the sorting algorithms, but we aim to simulate more algorithms in the future.Users can choose their required sorting algorithm. Then they will give input according to their wish. Our software will simulate those data according to their selected sorting algorithm.Our software will clearly visualize the selected sorting algorithm and its consecutive passes.
